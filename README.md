# MAVGAnalysis

## In-Flight Analysis for PX4

This JavaFx based tool enables PX4 Users to record and analyse data published via UDP during flight. It is not intended to replace the QGC.

**Status:** Last updated 26/02/2016 

Stable branch: Stable_V0.2

**Features:**

- Realtime data acquisition (50ms sampling)
- Trigger recording manually or by selectable flight-mode/state changes
- Choosable stop-recording delay
- Display of  key-figures during and after recording (with horizontal scrolling)
- Display of basic vehicle information, like mode, battery status, messages and sensor availability
- XY Analysis for selected key-figures
- MAVLink inspector
- OpenStreepMap viewer of global position and raw gps data with option to record path (requires internet access)

**In preparation:**

- 3D Analysis of selected key figures

**How to build on OSX** *(other platforms may need adjustments in* `build.xml`*)*:

- Clone repository
- Goto main directory  `cd MAVGCL-MAVGAnalysis/MAVGCL`
- Run `ant all`

**How to start (all platforms):**

- Goto directory `/dist`

- Start either UDP with `java -jar MAVGAnalysis.jar --peerAddress=172.168.178.1`

   *(PX4 standard ports used, replace IP with yours)*

  or `java -jar MAVGAnalysis.jar --peerAddress=127.0.0.1` for SITL (jMAVSim)

  or just `java -jar MAVGAnalysis.jar`for a basic demo.

**How to deploy on OSX:**

- Modify `build.xml` to adjust  `peer` property.

- Run `ant_deploy`
